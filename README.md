A Star Wars Galaxies server, based upon SWGEmu's Core3 / Engine3.  Roleplay-friendly, with a focus on quality of life, we are not your average glowbat zone.


 

 

### Getting Started

 

* You need to install Star Wars Galaxies from disk.

  * We recommend installing to a Tarkin-specific directory if you also have accounts on other servers, to avoid file conflicts.

* [Download the Tarkin launcher (TO COME)](http://www)

  * This will keep you up-to-date with current Tarkin patches.

* [--Alternative-- manual installation (last updated 3/11/19)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tgeeh6iqNBBHe6f8mR9x23DgbIBBjZjK/view)

  * Only use if you do not wish to use the launcher.  You will not auto-receive updates, which may cause client crashes if you are not using the most current files.  Use at your own risk.

### Credits 

Current and former staff:

Kinshi first and foremost, founder of the original SWGCanon/Tarkin, for the foundation upon which we have built Tarkin's Revenge (especially NPC Player Cities, but so many more contributions, far too numerous to list them all - including most of the vision and principles by which we operate.  We would not exist without Kinshi's vision), along with Skolten, our web dev, as well as Wol, Gurgi, and Zetlaux, who served as staff and code contributors on dugeons and screenplays during Tarkin's original run.

Liakhara (Github: stacy19201325) for merging original tarkin_scripts and TarkinII/Core3 with current SWGEmu code, craftable factional armors, craftable CU/NGE weapons,  vast amounts of client asset implementation, many dungeon revamps, SUI menu to choose combat mission levels, Jedi and faction trophies, custom DNA naming, many camp changes, world snapshot changes, recycler changes, Star Tours Adventure Service, custom color palettes, most other Post-Tarkin II contributions so far.

ParadymShift (Github: Spartan5150) for networking, hardware, and forum management, as well as world snapshot editing, and community relations.

Tatwi, for the contributions he made through the various iterations of Tarkin: /tarkin command, houseplop, medical services terminals, skill training NPCs, hunting mission revamp, mission terminal renaming, new player email, CA/AA to drop with one stat only, pitch/roll/yaw, and various other quality of life improvements.

Devereux (Github: Trakaa) for fixes correcting decrimenting of manufacturing schematics, making mind heal work on stims, recoloring armor with multiple palettes, making current resource list export in a format compatible with swgcraft, on Tarkin II.

Taylaria for some work on mobile templates on Tarkin II.

SealGunman for our knee-jerk hatred of Fixer, thanks to crashing our server repeatedly due to a screenplay bug on Tarkin II.

Sources and inspiration from other servers:

Borrie for Wall Pack and Windmill.

Halyn's comments in ModtheGalaxy chat for slicing locked briefcases.

Toxic for contributions of galaxy-wide invites, unstick command, and changes to /move on Tarkin II as well as inspiration to make a SUI window upon character creation to describe the server.

Most likely Red as orginator for CA/AA being named after the stat - modified and contributed by Tatwi, modified again by Liakhara as it exists in its current state on Tarkin's Revenge.

Unsure: Serverwide announcements of important events like pvp kills, new server joins, etc.  We encountered this playing on Remastered and used this idea here on Tarkin's Revenge, but I don't believe the idea originated there.  Let us know if you know for certain where this idea originated.
